# mewpipe_api
School project: The goal was to design an API that implements "youtube-like" features (i.e, upload and manage videos via an account)

Python 2.7: Django + REST Framework

Also used ffmpeg (convert) and Celery

See a live demo here:

NOTE: Registration is disabled in this demo. You'll have a server error if you try to create an account. I made this to prevent people for uploading everything & anything...

Since it is a school project, i won't bother documenting how to install this API. But if you have any question(s) feel free to ask ;)
